# What It Does Not Solve

The 1..n Method addresses decision-making about what to build and when. It does not address everything.

---

**Strategy and vision.** The method assumes you know what problems you're solving and for whom. It's about execution, not direction.

**Leadership.** Someone has to make hard choices and protect the focus set. The method doesn't work without that.

**Long-range timelines.** It won't tell you when something ships six months from now. It acknowledges that predictions degrade with distance.

**Technical decisions.** Architecture, tech debt, build vs. buy—these are engineering judgments outside the method's scope.

**Culture and politics.** If the organization can't say no, or punishes honest constraints, no framework will help.
