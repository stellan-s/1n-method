# Core Principles

These principles govern the 1..n Method. They describe the constraints that development operates under and how the method responds to them.

1. Development work always contains friction, caused by collaboration, communication, dependencies, and limited attention. Friction can be reduced but never eliminated.
2. Time and attention are strictly limited resources and must be actively conserved.
3. Every additional item allowed to burden the system adds friction, regardless of intention or quality.
4. Prioritization is only meaningful within a short, active time window.
5. 1..n is the small set of work the team has chosen to work on now; exactly one thing is most important and ordering beyond that has rapidly diminishing value.
6. Beyond 1..n exists a cognitive horizon: what the team can hold in mind simultaneously, without requiring order or action.
7. 1..n is a strict subset of the cognitive horizon; only what is included in 1..n is operationally binding.
8. Everything outside the cognitive horizon should be inert and not read, prioritized, broken down, or estimated.
9. Choice—saying no—is the most important leadership act; the product area is responsible for choosing against and protecting development from irrelevant information.

## Key Terms

**1..n** — The focus set. A small, bounded list of active work (typically 1–3 items). The "1" is the most important thing; the rest are ordered but with diminishing significance.

**Cognitive horizon** — The outer boundary of what a team can hold in awareness at once. Items within the horizon can be seen and considered, but they carry no commitment. Think of it as peripheral vision for work.

**Operationally binding** — Work that the team has committed to. It has resources, attention, and organizational support. The team is accountable for progress on binding work. Only items in 1..n are binding; everything else is not.

**Inert** — Work that exists but has no momentum. It is not read, estimated, refined, or scheduled. It may become active later, or never. Inert work makes no claim on attention.
