# Core Principles

- Focus and attention are strictly limited.
- Only a small set of work can be active at any time.
- Exactly one thing is most important; ordering beyond that has diminishing value.
- Commitment is explicit and present-tense.
- New work enters only by replacing existing commitments.
- Work that is not chosen must be allowed to exist without momentum.
- Only work in focus is binding.
- Progress is judged by fitness for purpose in production.
- Saying no is a leadership responsibility.
