# Leadership and "When?"

One of the most common questions in product development is: **"When will X be done?"**

The 1..n Method does not eliminate this question, but it changes how leaders answer it—honestly, without false precision.

## The Problem with False Precision

Traditional approaches often demand specific dates or timelines for work that hasn't started yet:

- "Feature Y will ship in Q3."
- "Project Z will take 8 weeks."
- "We'll deliver 12 story points per sprint."

These statements provide the illusion of control, but they're often based on guesses, not data. When reality diverges—and it will—the organization faces a choice: acknowledge the miss (damaging credibility) or push harder to meet the date (damaging quality or morale).

**The 1..n Method rejects false precision.** Instead, it provides frameworks for honest communication.

## How to Answer "When will X be done?"

### If X is in the Focus Set

"We're working on it right now. It will be done when it's fit for purpose in production. We'll know more as we learn."

**Why:** Fitness for purpose is the real definition of done. Arbitrary deadlines don't change how long it takes to solve a problem correctly.

**Optional addition (if there's meaningful signal):** "Based on what we know today, we expect to validate this in production within [timeframe]. That's conditional on no major surprises."

### If X is Inert

"It's not in our current focus. If it becomes more important than what we're doing now, we'll replace something to make room. Right now, we don't have a timeline."

**Why:** Inert means inactive. Providing a timeline for inactive work creates a false commitment.

**Optional addition:** "If this becomes urgent, let's talk about what we'd need to stop to start it."

### If X Doesn't Exist Yet

"We haven't scoped or prioritized that yet. If it's important, we can evaluate it, but it would need to displace something currently in focus."

**Why:** Honest acknowledgment of reality prevents overpromising.

## Roadmaps Without False Precision

Many stakeholders—executives, investors, customers—want to see a **roadmap**: a view of what's coming and roughly when.

The 1..n Method allows roadmaps, but with important constraints:

### Use State Language, Not Calendar Dates

Instead of:
- Q1: Feature A
- Q2: Feature B
- Q3: Feature C

Use:
- **Now:** Feature A (in focus set)
- **Under Consideration:** Features B, C (inert, unordered, may become replacement candidates)

**Why:** State language describes current reality without creating queue positions or false time commitments. Items "under consideration" are not sequenced—they are all equally inert until a replacement decision is made.

### Conditional Quarter Labels (If Required)

Some organizations require quarterly planning for budgeting or coordination. In those cases, use **conditional language**:

- "If current work completes as expected, Feature B may enter focus in Q2. This is a hypothesis, not a commitment."
- "Q3 capacity is reserved for emerging priorities and technical health work, details TBD."

**Why:** Conditional framing preserves honesty while meeting organizational reporting needs.

### Treat Distant Horizons as Scenarios

For work beyond the next quarter, use **scenario language**:

- "Possible H2 directions: internationalization, enterprise features, or platform migration. We'll decide closer to the horizon based on learner insights."

**Why:** Scenarios acknowledge uncertainty and leave room for adaptation.

## Leadership Discipline: Resisting Pressure for Certainty

Stakeholders—especially those outside engineering—will pressure leaders for specific dates and commitments.

**The leader's job is to hold the line:**

1. **Acknowledge the desire for certainty.** "I understand you need to plan. Here's what we know and what we don't."
2. **Provide context, not promises.** "We're focused on X right now. Y is under consideration—if it becomes more important than current work, we'll make a replacement decision."
3. **Reframe success.** "Our goal is to solve [problem] well, not to hit an arbitrary date. We'll know it's done when it works in production."

**Why:** Trading short-term comfort (a confident answer) for long-term trust (honest uncertainty) is a leadership discipline.

## What About Dependencies?

If another team, vendor, or partner depends on your work, you owe them information—but not false precision.

**Good:** "We're working on this now. We expect to have something testable in [rough timeframe]. We'll keep you updated as we learn more."

**Bad:** "It will be done March 15th." (Unless you have very high confidence, which is rare.)

**Why:** Dependencies deserve honesty, not overconfidence.

## Summary

The 1..n Method replaces false precision with honest communication:

- **In focus:** "We're working on it; it's done when it's fit for purpose."
- **Inert:** "Not active; no timeline, no queue position, no implied future."
- **Roadmaps:** State language ("now" and "under consideration") over calendar dates or sequencing.
- **Conditional quarters:** Allowed, but framed as hypotheses, not commitments.

Leadership's role is to protect this honesty, even under pressure. Credibility comes from delivering value, not from meeting arbitrary dates.
