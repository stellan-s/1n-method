# What It Does Not Solve

The 1..n Method is not a universal solution. It is designed to address specific problems in product development decision-making. Many important problems lie outside its scope.

This document explicitly lists what the method **does not solve** to prevent misapplication and unmet expectations.

---

## 1. Organizational Politics

The method does not resolve power struggles, hidden agendas, or interpersonal conflicts.

**Why:** These are human and cultural problems, not structural ones. A decision-making framework cannot fix trust deficits or misaligned incentives.

**What helps:** Leadership alignment, clear accountability, and a culture of honest communication.

---

## 2. Weak or Absent Leadership

The method requires leaders who can make hard prioritization decisions and accept trade-offs.

If leadership is unwilling to say "no," unable to displace work, or insists on accumulating commitments without constraints, the method will not function.

**Why:** Bounded focus and replacement require someone with authority to enforce the constraint.

**What helps:** Executive buy-in and a willingness to operate transparently within constraints.

---

## 3. Unclear Strategy or Vision

The method assumes the organization knows—broadly—what problems it's trying to solve and for whom.

It does not generate product strategy, identify market opportunities, or define company vision.

**Why:** The method is about *how* to execute, not *what* to build. Prioritization requires a sense of direction.

**What helps:** Clear strategic goals, user research, and market understanding.

---

## 4. Technical Debt or Architecture Decisions

The method does not prescribe how to manage technical debt, refactor codebases, or make architecture trade-offs.

**Why:** These are engineering decisions that depend on system context, not general process principles.

**What helps:** Engineering rigor, technical leadership, and honest accounting of system health.

---

## 5. Predictable Long-Range Timelines

The method does not provide certainty about when specific features will ship months or years in advance.

It acknowledges that estimation accuracy degrades with distance and that reality changes.

**Why:** False precision creates false confidence. Honest uncertainty is more useful than inaccurate certainty.

**What helps:** Scenario planning, conditional language, and focusing on outcomes rather than feature lists.

---

## 6. Individual Performance Management

The method does not define how to evaluate, promote, or compensate individuals.

**Why:** It operates at the team and organizational level, not the individual contributor level.

**What helps:** Separate performance frameworks that assess impact, growth, and contribution.

---

## 7. Perfect Information

The method does not eliminate uncertainty, ambiguity, or the need for judgment.

Decisions are still made with incomplete information. Fitness for purpose is still a judgment call.

**Why:** Reality is messy. The method provides structure for navigating uncertainty, not eliminating it.

**What helps:** Empirical feedback loops, frequent reality checks, and willingness to adapt.

---

## 8. Scaling Across Thousands of People

The method is designed for product teams and organizations, not for enterprises with thousands of engineers working on unrelated products.

**Why:** At massive scale, different coordination structures may be needed. The method optimizes for small, focused teams.

**What helps:** Federated decision-making, clear ownership boundaries, and decentralized autonomy.

---

## 9. External Dependencies

The method does not solve problems caused by external blockers: vendor delays, third-party API changes, regulatory requirements, or partner coordination.

**Why:** These are outside the organization's control.

**What helps:** Explicit risk management, contingency planning, and honest communication about external constraints.

---

## 10. Cultural Resistance to Saying "No"

If the organization's culture punishes saying "no" or rewards promising everything, the method will struggle.

**Why:** Replacement and bounded focus require the ability to decline work, even when stakeholders object.

**What helps:** Leadership modeling, psychological safety, and treating "no" as a strategic tool.

---

## Summary

The 1..n Method is a tool for improving decision-making about what to build and when. It is not a substitute for leadership, strategy, culture, or technical excellence. Recognizing its boundaries allows it to be applied effectively where it fits.
