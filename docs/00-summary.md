# Summary

## What is the 1..n Method?

The 1..n Method is a specification for how product organizations make decisions about what to build, when to build it, and how to measure progress.

It is built on observable constraints about human cognition, organizational communication, and software engineering reality. Rather than prescribing processes or ceremonies, it provides principles that guide decision-making.

## Purpose

Product organizations often struggle with:
- Backlogs that grow unbounded
- Commitments made without capacity constraints
- Difficulty answering "when will X be done?" honestly
- Measuring activity instead of outcomes
- Context-switching across too many initiatives

The 1..n Method addresses these by optimizing for small, focused sets of work that replace existing reality rather than accumulate indefinitely.

## What It Is

- A set of **principles** for organizing and executing work
- A **decision flow** for determining what enters active development
- Guidance on **metrics** that measure fitness for purpose in production
- A **rationale** grounded in observable constraints (see Foundations appendix)

## What It Is Not

- A project management tool or software platform
- A prescriptive process framework (like Scrum or SAFe)
- A guarantee of predictable delivery timelines
- A solution to organizational politics or weak leadership
- A replacement for strategy or vision

## Core Insight

**Replacement over accumulation.** Work should replace existing items in a bounded focus set, not append to an unbounded list. This constraint forces prioritization at the moment of maximum information and aligns the organization around a small, shared reality.

## Core Principles

- Focus is constrained; attention and coordination are finite.
- Friction is inherent in development and cannot be eliminated, only reduced.
- Only a small set of work can be meaningfully active at any time.
- Prioritization beyond the near horizon is inherently unreliable.
- Commitment requires replacement; new work displaces existing work.
- Work that is not chosen must be allowed to exist without momentum.
- Only what is in focus is binding; everything else is uncommitted.
- Progress is measured by fitness for purpose in production, not activity.
- Saying no is a leadership responsibility, not a process failure.

## Key Concepts

- **Focus Set:** A small, bounded list of active work (typically 1–3 items per team)
- **Inert:** Items not in the focus set; they exist but are explicitly inactive
- **Replacement:** New work enters only by displacing existing work
- **Fitness for Purpose:** The primary measure of success—does it solve the problem in production?

## Who Should Read This

- CTOs and engineering leaders establishing operating principles
- CEOs and founders seeking alignment between strategy and execution
- Product leaders designing decision-making frameworks
- Teams looking for an alternative to backlog-driven development
