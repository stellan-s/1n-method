# Foundations

The 1..n Method rests on observable constraints about how organizations, humans, and software systems actually work. These are not aspirational values—they are reality constraints that any method must accommodate.

## Foundation 1: Cognitive Load is Bounded

Individual humans cannot hold unlimited context. Teams cannot effectively coordinate across unlimited concurrent initiatives.

**Implication:** The number of things in active focus must be small. When everything is a priority, nothing is.

## Foundation 2: Communication Overhead Scales Non-Linearly

As the number of active initiatives grows, coordination cost grows faster than linear. Handoffs, status updates, and synchronization meetings multiply.

**Implication:** Reducing the number of concurrent streams of work reduces organizational friction more than proportionally.

## Foundation 3: Software is Modified, Not Appended

Codebases are living systems. New work often requires changing, removing, or replacing existing code. The mental model of "adding features to a list" does not match engineering reality.

**Implication:** Framing work as replacement—not accumulation—aligns mental models with how software actually evolves.

## Foundation 4: Estimation Accuracy Degrades with Distance

Predictions about distant future work are inaccurate. Uncertainty increases with time and with ignorance of implementation details.

**Implication:** Commitments should be limited to work on the near horizon. Long-range roadmaps should be treated as hypotheses, not promises.

## Foundation 5: Reality is the Only Ground Truth

What matters is whether something works in production for real users, not whether it passed acceptance criteria or met an internal definition of done.

**Implication:** Metrics should measure fitness for purpose in production, not activity or velocity.

## Foundation 6: Context Switching is Expensive

When individuals or teams switch between multiple unrelated efforts, they lose time to context reconstruction. Deep work requires sustained focus.

**Implication:** Minimize concurrent streams of work. Serial focus on one thing at a time is often faster than parallel execution of many things.

## Foundation 7: Prioritization Under Constraint is Clarifying

When forced to choose what to stop in order to start something new, organizations make better decisions than when allowed to accumulate unbounded lists.

**Implication:** Replacement forces honest prioritization at the moment of maximum information.

These foundations are not negotiable. They describe the environment in which the method operates. The principles and practices of the 1..n Method are designed to work with these constraints, not against them.
