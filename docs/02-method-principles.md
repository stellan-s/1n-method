# Method Principles

The 1..n Method is governed by a small set of principles derived from the [Foundations](01-foundations.md). These principles guide how work is selected, organized, and measured.

## Principle 1: Maintain a Bounded Focus Set

Each team maintains a **focus set** of active work. This set is small—typically 1 to 3 items.

- The focus set represents what the team is actually working on right now.
- Work in the focus set has full organizational support: attention, resources, and permission to finish.
- Everything else is **inert**.

**Why:** Bounded focus reduces cognitive load, minimizes context switching, and forces clarity about what truly matters.

## Principle 2: Work Enters by Replacement

New work enters the focus set only by **replacing** existing work.

- To start something new, an existing item must leave the focus set.
- Departure happens when work is done, explicitly abandoned, or deliberately paused.
- Replacement forces a real-time prioritization decision: "Is this new thing more important than what we're doing now?"

**Why:** Replacement prevents unbounded accumulation and ensures decisions are made with current information, not stale assumptions.

## Principle 3: Everything Else is Inert

Work not in the focus set is **inert**—it exists as an idea, but it is explicitly not active.

- Inert items are not assigned, scheduled, or promised.
- They can be documented, discussed, and refined, but without the expectation of immediate action.
- Inert work may become active later, or it may never happen.

**Why:** Explicit inertness removes the illusion that "backlog items" are commitments. It clarifies that most ideas will not be built, and that's fine.

## Principle 4: Optimize for Fitness for Purpose in Production

The measure of success is whether something solves the problem for real users in production—not whether it meets internal acceptance criteria, story points, or velocity targets.

**Why:** Reality is the only ground truth. Activity metrics (story points, velocity, tickets closed) measure motion, not value.

## Principle 5: Commitments Respect Capacity

Only commit to what can be done with available capacity and current knowledge.

- If capacity is unknown, acknowledge it.
- If new work is urgent, explicitly decide what to displace.
- Do not layer commitments without removing others.

**Why:** Over-commitment creates false expectations and thrashes the organization. Honest acknowledgment of constraints builds trust.

## Principle 6: Reality Over Activity

Measure progress by changes in production reality, not by internal process completion.

- Did the customer problem get solved?
- Did the system behavior improve?
- Did the business outcome change?

**Why:** Process metrics (burndown, velocity) create the illusion of progress without requiring actual value delivery.

## Principle 7: Clarity Over Certainty

Be clear about what is known and what is not. Avoid false precision in timelines or scope estimates.

- If you don't know when something will be done, say so.
- If a timeline is conditional, state the conditions.
- Precision without accuracy is misleading.

**Why:** Honesty about uncertainty allows better risk management and decision-making than false confidence.

These principles form the core operating logic of the 1..n Method. They are simple, but applying them consistently requires discipline and leadership support.
