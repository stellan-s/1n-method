## Overview

The 1..n Method is a specification for how product organizations make decisions about what to build and when. It prioritizes small, focused sets of work that replace existing reality rather than accumulating unbounded backlogs.

This repository contains the method specification—not an implementation or tool. Organizations can apply these principles using whatever tools fit their context.

**Method Specification Version:** 1.1.0

## Who This Is For

- CTOs and engineering leaders establishing operating principles
- CEOs and founders seeking alignment between strategy and execution
- Product leaders designing decision-making frameworks
- Teams looking for an alternative to backlog-driven development

## Quick Start
